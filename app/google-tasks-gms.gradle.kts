// Google Tasks import requires proprietary Google Play Services + Credentials libraries.
// These coordinates are deliberately NOT in gradle/libs.versions.toml: the F-Droid scanner
// resolves `libs.*` catalog accessors and flags com.google.android.gms / *play-services as
// non-free, which fails the fdroid build. Keeping them as hardcoded strings here lets the
// fdroid recipe `scandelete` this whole file (and src/nonfdroid) so the scanner never sees
// them, while the github/playstore flavors still get the real implementation.
//
// TRADEOFF: because they're outside the version catalog, `versionCatalogUpdate` will NOT bump
// them. `./gradlew checkDependencyUpdates` still REPORTS newer versions for them (they're live
// on github/playstoreImplementation on a normal checkout) — but you must apply any bump by
// editing the version literals below by hand.
